        These four core aspects were developed over time through my own life experiences. 
        Growing up in New York City with three siblings and a single father, life was not always consistent or easy.

        <span class="profile-labels">Welcome to Athletic Prospects,</span> where our mission is to provide you the tools and strategies to become a Next Level Athlete. 
        A Next Level athlete has the four key skills necessary to stand out as a player: a consistent strength training plan, 
        a solid progression in their college recruiting, key practices for skill development and ongoing work on their mental performance. <br />

        <span class="profile-labels">A consistent strength training plan</span> sets you up to be in the best possible shape for your sport. 
        Consistent training is imperative to your development as an athlete in order to progress as a player 
        and to be prepared for all of the physical demands that come from being a student athlete.<br />

        <span class="profile-labels">A solid progression in your college recruitment</span> will help to bridge the gap between you, as the player, 
        and the college coaches of your desired schools. The goal is to put you in the best possible position, ahead of time, 
        in order to increase your exposure and opportunities for your future as a collegiate athlete.<br />

        <span class="profile-labels">Your skill development</span> as an athlete shows your dedication to the sport and works to constantly challenge you and improve your skills as a player.<br /> 

        <span class="profile-labels">Mental performance</span> is often the piece that most athletes are missing. This elite mindset will keep you on track with your goals, 
        improve you as a player and teammate and will take you to that next level as a successful athlete. 
        Many athletes are missing the strong mindset that allows them to push through challenging games, brush off errors, 
        pull from your confidence when itâ€™s needed and support and motivate your teammates to create a winning culture.<br />

        <span class="profile-labels">This platform</span> will give you the ultimate tools and key tips that you need to progress as a collegiate player. 
        We offer every athlete a FREE player profile in order to increase their exposure and provide them this vital 
        step in progressing in the college recruiting process. Here, you will also find key tips and posts created by 
        myself and other coaches to support you in your growth as an athlete.
